# I will go to you like the first snow

Before I held you, I didn't know

That the world I was in

Was this bright

I reached you with a small breath of life

It's a love that called out to me fearlessly

I liked it so much

Watching over you, my heart fluttering

Even when I was ridiculously jealous

All of those ordinary moments

In the dark eternity

In that long wait

Like sunshine, you fell down to me

Before I let go of you, I didn't know

That the world I am in

Was this lonely

Pretty flowers bloomed and withered here

The season of you will never come again

I started to become greedy

I wanted to live with you, grow old with you

Hold your wrinkled hands

And say how warm my life was

It was just one blessing

After that short encounter

You cried like the rain

I wanted to be

Happy for once

But that made you cry

Forget everything and move on

Because I will go to you

When your breath

Calls out to me again

I won't ever forget

Watching over you, my heart fluttering

Even when I was ridiculously jealous

All of those moments that you gave to me

Some day, we'll meet again

It'll be the happiest day

I will go to you like the first snow

I will go to you
